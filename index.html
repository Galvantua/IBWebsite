			Life in the twenty-first century, in an interconnected, globalized world, requires critical-thinking skills and a sense of international-mindedness, something that International Baccalaureate Diploma Program students learn to know and understand.

		<br>

		<p>
			The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program is designed as an academically challenging 
			and balanced program of education that prepares students, generally ages sixteen to nineteen, for 
			success at the university level and in life beyond.  In the U.S. the program is taught during grades 
			eleven and twelve and on the worldwide level has gained recognition and respect since its inception 
			in 1968.  The entire IB Program encompassing the Primary Years and Middle Years programs as well as 
			the Diploma Program enrolls some 775,000 students in 2815 schools in 138 countries.
		</p>

		<br>

		<p>
			The IB Diploma Program provides students the opportunity to explore a 
			subject's breadth and depth greater than any other academic curriculum 
			and includes extensive study of the nature of knowledge itself in its 
			unique Theory of Knowledge course. Students also engage in service oriented 
			activities outside of the traditional classroom through IB's Creativity, 
			Action, and Service requirements.  In addition, the program has earned a 
			reputation for its rigorous external and internal assessments that meet global 
			standards and by its emphasis on educating the whole student - intellectually, 
			physically, emotionally and ethically.  Besides being well-prepared for the 
			challenges of college, the IB Diploma graduate possesses the characteristics 
			necessary to be a productive, contributing citizen in the new global age.
